# DSA-Pattern-templates

# 📘 DSA Pattern Templates

This repository contains **clean, reusable Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) pattern templates**.

Instead of storing full problem solutions, this repo focuses on **patterns** — the repeatable logic structures that appear across multiple DSA problems.

The goal is to make DSA:
- easier to revise
- easier to recognize
- easier to implement under pressure

---

## 🎯 Why this repository exists

Most DSA struggles happen because:
- problems are forgotten over time
- patterns are not recognized quickly
- implementations feel confusing even after solving before

This repository acts as a **pattern reference handbook** — helping you recall *how to think*, not *what to memorize*.

## 🧠 What this repository contains

- Core DSA patterns (Linked List first)
- Step-by-step logic explanation
- Minimal, commented template code
- Dry-run examples for intuition
- Common mistakes to avoid
